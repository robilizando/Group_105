## __Project Proposal__

### __Motivation and Purpose__  
Aircraft bird strikes can have significant impact on public and private interests. A single bird strike can result in an aircraft losing all power and the implications of this event mid-flight are clear. Airlines have a vested interest in ensuring the safety of its passengers while minimizing aircraft repair time and repair cost. Consequently, information regarding aircraft bird strikes can provide useful insight for airlines in determining flight routes, maintenance plans, and forecasting repair costs. The purpose of the ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app is to provide interactive insight into recent trends in aircraft bird strikes and factors that contribute to, or are related to, the number of and damage caused by bird strikes. This will hopefully contribute in aiding airlines in meeting their mandate and serve as an informative tool for the general public.

### __Description of the Data__  

The bird strike data set being visualized contains approximately 10,000 observations for 29 states ___(for 50 airports)\*\*___ in the United States between 1990 and 2002. Bird strikes are classified into four damage categories: no damage, minor, medium, and substantial. There are several factors that contribute to / are related to a bird strike event and its severity, these <may> include:   

- flight phase (climb, approach, take-off, descent, and landing roll),  
- time of day (day, night, dusk, dawn), and ___<we need to decide if this will be used / how to implement / could be as part of the bar charts and switching out the variables>___   
-  wildlife size (small, medium, large) ___<we need to decide if this will be used / how to implement / could be as part of the bar charts and switching out the variables>___  

___\*\*<need to decide if we should allow for changing between state and airport_name (50 observations) for the heatmap --> again just another axis variable change>___


### __Research Questions to be Explored__  
    
The interactive visualizations in the ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app aims to provide insight for the following questions:  

1. How has the number of and damage caused by bird strikes changed between 1990 and 2002?  
2. What factors/conditions effect the number of and damage caused by bird strikes?  
3. Which states ___<include airports here as well?>___ observed the largest number of bird strikes between 1990 and 2002?

Suppose Persephone is the CEO of one of the newest commercial airlines in the United States, Eagle Express.  Eagle Express has a mandate of providing timely and low-cost flights while ensuring passenger safety above all else. To be competitive in the market, Persephone knows that efficient management of her fleet is necessary; she needs to target high volume routes and limit foreseeable delays and costs. Recently, Persephone was made aware that aircraft bird strikes can pose a challenge to her airline's ability to meet its mandate; as a prudent CEO, she decides to investigate and stumbles upon the  ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app. Persephone first wants to [explore] the trend of bird strikes over time; having discovered that most bird strikes cause no damage, she then wants to [compare] the trends of bird strikes that cause damage to airlines - Persephone can do this using the ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app by [filtering] out the damage categories she is interested in over variable time periods.    

Having [compared] the trend of damage causing bird strikes, Persephone now wants to [identify] what factors and conditions result in the most damage causing bird strikes. The ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app allows her to [target] several factors (by filtering through flight phase, time of day, wildlife size) and [analyze] relationships between them. Persephone will be able to identify certain flight phases or wildlife sizes that cause the greatest amount of damage to aircraft and may be able to apply mitigative measures.    

Finally, Persephone wants to [identify] which states to target for potential routes but wants to make sure that her aircrafts will not be subjected to more damage causing bird strikes than necessary. The heatmap allows her to identify high bird strike states and directly [compare] several states (by filtering the states she is interested in). Further, the interactivity of the heatmap provides her with additional information for a given state in a given year.     

By using the ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app, Persephone can decide whether or not bird strikes pose a significant challenge to her airline's viability. If she chooses to minimize damage caused by bird strikes to her fleet, the ___<name_of_app: Aircraft Bird Strikes in the USA>___ app provides her with a good foundation to make informed decisions on route selection, mitigative measures, and whether or not further studies are required.
